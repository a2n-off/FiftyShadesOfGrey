# FiftyShadesOfGrey
a colorscheme made w/ grey

# information
The color green is there because I couldn't find a case where these colors were used in the console.

For the moment I leave them there to see when they will appear and to update in that case.

This code has been tested with `Konsole` under [`OhMyZsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/) with the following plugins:
- theme : [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt)
- git 
- npm 
- yarn 
- zsh-autosuggestions 
- zsh-syntax-highlighting 
- gitignore 
- docker 
- docker-compose 
- heroku

# version
- v1.1 update exec file color
- v1.0 beta
